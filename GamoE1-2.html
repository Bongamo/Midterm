<h2 style="color:white; font-family:georgia; font-size:30px; background-color:#000000">Something About Myself</h2>
<p style="font-family:impact">I'm Bon Gamo, born and raised in Dumaguete City, currently enrolled in Computer Science, and a loud and proud true red Sillimanian. I chose this course with the intent to finish and graduate so 
I could work at my Uncle's Company in the states, my Uncle has been my main inspiration as to why I took up this course and I am basically trying to follow in his footsteps. Graduating from this course
will be my main Goal since from what I have observed and heard, the mortality rate of this course is pretty high considering a lot of seniors either dropped out or shifted to different courses. In the events
that I may end up struggling or might not pass this course, I'll just shift to IT :PP. Computer Studies is my first choice and hopefully it will go well for me.

More about myself is that I enjoy physical activities, I am a consistent participant in the gym with me working out 5 times a week, I have played for the varsity teams for almost every major ball games you can think of.
I am also a coach and a fighter for the Maxzeal Muay Thai team, so I am very well vered in martial arts, I trained from the beggining of quarantine which I consistently attended for 4 years straight. I also am very
into video games, my days don't feel complete without having to play at least 1 of the any games I enjoy. Music is also one of the things I am passionate about, although I can't play any instruments, listening to Music
is part of my daily routine. </p>
<p>My favorite song is White Ferrari by Frank Ocean Skibidi.</p>
